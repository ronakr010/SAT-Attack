# SAT-Attack
◦ Implemented SAT-attack to break Logic Encryption techniques like Random Logic Locking (RLL)
◦ Applied RLL on Logic circuits with key-size = 32, 64 &128 bits for Logic Encryption
◦ Applied SAT-attack on RLL encrypted ISCAS’89 and ITC’99 benchmark circuits to found correct key
◦ Analysed time taken and No. of iterations taken to break Logic Encryption
